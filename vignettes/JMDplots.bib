	grain size, and aqueous organic ligand concentration. Rates were
	measured using both open- and closed-system reactors in fluids of
	constant ionic strength. Element release was non-stoichiometric and
	followed the general trend of Fe, Mg& #{xa0;&gt;&} # xa0;Al& #{xa0;&gt;&} # xa0;Si. Biotite surface area normalised dissolution rates (ri)
	in the acidic range, generated from Si release, are consistent with
	the empirical rate law: r i = k H, i a H + xi where kH,i refers to
	an apparent rate constant, a H + designates the activity of protons,
	and xi stands for a reaction order with respect to protons. Rate
	constants range from 2.15& #{xa0;ÃÂ&} # xa0;10Ã¢ÂÂ10 to 30.6& #{xa0;ÃÂ&} # xa0;10Ã¢ÂÂ10& #{xa0;(molesbiotite&} # xa0;mÃ¢ÂÂ2& #{xa0;sÃ¢ÂÂ1) with reaction orders ranging from 0.31 to 0.58. At near-neutral pH in the closed-system experiments, the release of Al was stoichiometric compared to Si, but Fe was preferentially retained in the solid phase, possibly as a secondary phase. Biotite dissolution was highly spatially anisotropic with its edges being Ã¢ÂÂ¼120&#xa0;times more reactive than its basal planes. Low organic ligand concentrations slightly enhanced biotite dissolution rates. These measured rates illuminate mineralÃ¢ÂÂfluidÃ¢ÂÂorganism chemical interactions, which occur in the natural environment, and how organic exudates enhance nutrient mobilisation for microorganism acquisition.},
