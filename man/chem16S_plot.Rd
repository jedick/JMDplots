\details{

\code{getrefseq} retrieves amino acid compositions and taxonomic names from the files \code{extdata/refseq/protein_refseq.csv.xz} and \code{extdata/refseq/taxid_names.csv.xz}.
By default, any species with greater than 20000 reference sequences is omitted; set \code{filterspecies} to FALSE to include all available species.

\code{taxacomp} plots the \ZC and \nH2O of taxonomic groups in RefSeq and their children.
\code{groups} can be the names of one or more taxonomic groups, or one of the following keywords: \samp{majorphyla} (phyla with more than 500 representatives), \samp{majorcellular} (non-viral (cellular) phyla with more than 60 representatives), \samp{proteobacteria}, \samp{acidobacteria}, or \samp{cyanobacteria} (classes within the indicated phylum and their orders).
Note that the keywords are all lower-case; use the upper-case name (e.g. \samp{Proteobacteria}) to plot the phylum and its orders.

\code{plotmet} plots the \ZC and \nH2O of community proteomes inferred by combining taxonomic abundances from 16S rRNA gene sequencing with RefSeq proteomes.
If \code{pch1} and \code{pch2} are provided, then two sample groups are identified by their plotting symbols in the metadata (see \code{\link{getmdat}}).
Star-shaped symbols are plotted to indicate the metrics computed for meta-samples created by aggregating the RDP counts for all samples in each sample group.

\code{addhull} uses \code{\link{polygon}} to draw a convex hull around the points given in \code{x}, \code{y}.
The lines are draw only in \code{outline} is TRUE; otherwise, the area of the hull is filled.
The fill color is a lightened (semi-transparent) shade of the color given in \code{basecol}.

\code{groupmet} makes ZC- or nH2O-abundance plots for taxonomic groups within two sample groups.
\code{groupperc} plots the percent contribution by each taxonomic group to the community difference of ZC or nH2O between sample groups, vs abundance of the taxonomic groups.
\code{getgroup} is the function that assembles the data for these plots.

}

\value{
\code{getgroup} returns a list with elements \samp{study}, \samp{param} (study key and chemical metric), \samp{pch1}, \samp{pch2}, \samp{col1}, \samp{col2} (single plotting symbols and color for each sample group), \samp{X1}, \samp{X2} (values of the selected chemical metric for individual taxa within each sample group), \samp{P1}, \samp{P2} (percent abundances of the taxa within each sample group), \samp{Pboth} (percent abundance of each taxon in both sample groups (combined)), \samp{DX}, (contribution of each taxon to the difference between sample groups), \samp{Xall}, (values of the metric for all taxa taken together in sample groups 1 and 2), \samp{taxon} (taxon names).

\samp{DX} is calculated as \code{(X2 - Xall[1]) * P2 / 100 - (X1 - Xall[1]) * P1 / 100}.
Note that \code{sum(DX) / diff(Xall)} equals 1.
