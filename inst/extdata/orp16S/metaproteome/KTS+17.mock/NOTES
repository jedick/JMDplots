The mass spectrometry metaproteomics data and protein
sequence databases have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via
the PRIDE54 partner repository with the data set identifiers PXD006118 (pure
culture and mock community data), PXD006343 (soda lake biomats), and
PXD006366 (re-analyses of the saliva metaproteomes by Grassl et al.9). A detailed
overview of the pure culture and mock community metaproteomic data for method
development can be found in Supplementary Table 5.

In summary, a single 260 min 1D-LC-MS/MS run on a
QExactive Plus Mass Spectrometer provides enough data to
detect most species in a community that contains 30 distinguish-
able species and features a range of proteinaceous biomass
abundances of more than two orders of magnitude.
