The mass spectrometry metaproteomics data and protein
sequence databases have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via
the PRIDE54 partner repository with the data set identifiers PXD006118 (pure
culture and mock community data), PXD006343 (soda lake biomats), and
PXD006366 (re-analyses of the saliva metaproteomes by Grassl et al.9). A detailed
overview of the pure culture and mock community metaproteomic data for method
development can be found in Supplementary Table 5.

This data is a case study done in the context of developing methods for
assessing the taxonomic composition of microbial communities using
metaproteomics. For this study with analyzed phototrophic biomats from two Soda
Lakes in the Canadian Rocky Mountains using metaproteomics. For protein
identification we generated a metagenome from which we predicted and annotated
the protein sequences used to analyze the metaproteomes. The database is
available in this PRIDE submission. Lake1 refers to Goodenough Lake (GEM,
51째19'47.64"N 121째38'28.90"W) and Lake2 referes to Last Chance Lake (LCM,
51째19'39.3" N 121째37'59.3"W).
