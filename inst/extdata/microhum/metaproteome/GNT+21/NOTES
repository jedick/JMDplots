The mass spectrometry proteomic data have been deposited in the
ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexch

Both meta-databases were merged with the human proteome. As a result, we
identified a total of 187 (25%) microbial proteins and 569 (75%) human proteins
(Supplementary Tables 9–12) in the saliva supernatant and cells using both
databases (redundant and non-redundant). The intensities of these unique and
razor peptides were further used for meta-protein quantification (Supplementary
Table 9–12).

To evaluate our metaproteomics data, we used a two-step data
analysis: i) First, we built two different databases retrieved from human
oral microbiome database (HOMD) [44] and Uniprot sources.
